# Temperature and Humidity Tracker

## Description
Webpage and application developed using REACT, node.js, and python for our client Wan Yeen Tradings.  
The REACT webpage allows a registered user to remotely view temperature and humidty sensor data saved to a database.  
The node.js backend provides database access to the frontend webpage and the sensor.  
The sensor program is designed to run on a raspberry pi connected to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.  While the program is running it will save the readings to the database at regular intervals.
